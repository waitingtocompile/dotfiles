# Dotfiles
This is my standard set of dotfiles for various applications (primarily neovim). I really need to keep these up-to-date. A few of these have windows specific settings, but should be trivial to fix for a \*nix system.

The current nvim config depends on the droid sans mono nerd font, found at https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/DroidSansMono/complete
